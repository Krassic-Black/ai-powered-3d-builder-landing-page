AI-Powered 3D Builder Landing Page

Project Overview:
Developed a sleek, modern landing page for an AI-powered 3D modeling tool, based on a Figma community design. Enhanced the original concept with fluid animations, micro-interactions, and a fully responsive layout for optimal UX across devices.

Key Contributions:
1 Developed a pixel-perfect implementation of the Figma design using React + TypeScript.
2 Integrated Framer Motion for dynamic animations (staggered text, hover effects, scroll-aware UI).
3 Optimized performance with lazy loading and lightweight transitions.
4 Built an interactive client logo carousel using React Slick.
5 Ensured mobile responsiveness with Tailwind CSS utility classes.

Tech Stack:
React · TypeScript · Tailwind CSS · Framer Motion · React Slick
